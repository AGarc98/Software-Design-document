# Software-Design-document
CS-230 assignment to complete a software design doc.

This doc was created for a company who was trying to create a gaming website where the games were run on a server and the user could access the games from many different operating systems.
for this document I created a good UML diagram and an explanation for it. 
Making sure to have a good UML diagram was very useful for working on the code as it served as a reference to work with.
I think the chart containing the comparison could be elaborated on and explored further. There is so many things to consider that it is hard to fit it into a chart.
It is important to keep the user in mind when designing because at the end of the day that is who the code is for. If the user experience is bad then it is not good code. 
The approach of looking into your options and figuring out which ones fit best for what you are trying to do is definitely a good first step and something I will do in the future.
